## How It Works

1. **Input or Trigger** â€” Users configure targeting rules (hashtags, profiles, or comment sections) from the Appilot dashboard to start the automation.  
2. **Core Logic** â€” Appilot connects to Android devices via wireless control, launching Threads, navigating to profiles, and executing follow actions.  
3. **Output or Action** â€” The system automatically follows users, logs results, and updates analytics dashboards.  
4. **Error Handling** â€” Retry and queue mechanisms ensure smooth execution, even in case of network delays or UI changes.  
5. **Scalability** â€” Multiple devices can run in parallel, each assigned to a unique account set.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Kotlin, Python, JavaScript  
- **Frameworks:** Appium, UI Automator, Espresso, Robot Framework  
- **Tools:** Appilot, ADB (wireless optional), Bluestacks, Nox Player, Scrcpy, Accessibility API
